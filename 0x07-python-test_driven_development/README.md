0x07. Python - Test-driven development

In this project, I learnt how to write tests for python programs.

Procedure followed to write tests:

Write test that'll fail

Then write the program code

Then test your program with the failing test to see if it will actually fail

Then write correct tests

Then test your code

Then write more codes

Then write more tests
